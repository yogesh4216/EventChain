Random Evening :

i was watching doraemon quietly, stretched out on the floor and fully into the episode. nobita was messing up again and i was smiling without thinking. suddenly mummy called me from the kitchen. i ignored it once, then she called again. i paused the tv and went. she just needed help with something small. i helped her, came back, and finished the episode feeling calm.
